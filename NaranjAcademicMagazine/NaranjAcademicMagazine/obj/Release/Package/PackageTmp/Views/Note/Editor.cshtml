                Peer review process is an essential component of the scientific process.
                Reviews by independent scientists provide advice to the editorial board of NAJ to choose best articles to publish.
                A double-blind reviewing process is conducted.
                NAJ is international in authorship and in readership and referees are carefully selected from the worldwide academic community.
                Referees’ names are kept confidential and may only be disclosed to Editors who are also instructed to maintain confidentiality.
                Unbiased consideration is given to all manuscripts offered for publication regardless of the race, gender, religious belief, ethnic origin, citizenship, political philosophy, age or reputation of the authors.

                <strong>Editor’s Declarations of Interest</strong>
                <br/>
                NAJ has asked its editors to provide brief statements on any interests which might be seen as having a potential
                bearing on the independence of their editorial evaluations. We have done so in the belief that such transparency
                is owed to our authors and readers, and is fair reciprocity for the requirement on declaration of interests which
                we put on authors, referees and book reviewers. Editorial staff is expected to distance themselves from any
                editorial decision-making where potential conflict of interest might be deemed to exist.
