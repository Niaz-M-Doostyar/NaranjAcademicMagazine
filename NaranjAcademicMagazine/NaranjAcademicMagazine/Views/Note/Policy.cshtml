                <strong>Submission Declaration</strong><br />
                The submission of an article implies that the work has not been published previously
                (except in the form of an abstract or as part of a published lecture or academic thesis or as an electronic preprint),
                that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly
                or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted,
                it will not be published elsewhere including electronically in the same form, in English or in any other language,
                without the written consent of the copyright-holder.

                <strong>Changes to Authorship</strong><br />
                NAJ accepts add and drop or rearrangement of author names in an accepted manuscript before publication.
                Before the accepted manuscript is published, requests to add or remove an author, or to rearrange the author
                names, must be sent to the Journal Secretary by the corresponding author. This request must include:
            <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The reason the name should be added or removed, or the author names rearranged.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Written confirmation (e-mail, fax, letter) from all authors that they agree with the addition,
                        removal or rearrangement. In the case of addition or removal of authors, this includes confirmation from the
                        author being added or removed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
